# HM - ML practise

1，Building a Voice Agent AI Assistant
  I designed and implemented an end-to-end voice agent pipeline using FastAPI. The system integrated Whisper for speech recognition, a local LLaMA 3 model for multi-turn dialogue generation, and CozyVoice for speech synthesis. The project gave me hands-on experience in building multi-modal systems, optimizing latency, and designing for natural human-AI interaction.

2，Training a Large Language Model
  I set up and trained a small-scale large language model on an GPU on inference.ai, building the full pipeline from data collection and cleaning (language detection, deduplication, PII removal) to supervised fine-tuning and LoRA adaptation. This project strengthened my understanding of large-scale training, data engineering, and optimization trade-offs, while also demonstrating resilience in working under resource constraints.
